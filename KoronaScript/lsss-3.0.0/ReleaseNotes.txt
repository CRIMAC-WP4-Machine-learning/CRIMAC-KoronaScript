  of LSSS will be backwards compatible to the existing model.

Future plans:
• Module for plankton inversion to compute size distribution of plankton inside regions
• Closer integration with the pre-processing system:
  - Starting and controlling the preprocessing from within the LSSS program
  - Taking advantage of the categorization in the interpretation module
• Transparent conversion between the LSSS raw data format and other formats
  like BEI and HAC variants
• Enable data calibration after data collection
• Manipulation of data offset between transducers
• Show position of towed vehicles in echogram window
